## Overview

T&N is a **web system for managing scholarly texts and personal notes**. It helps users organise and track the texts they have read, create detailed summaries, and optionally share their notes with others.  

Created originally to track my reading during my bachelors. It is a system I keep using in my PhD. Designed for students, researchers, and knowledge enthusiasts in mind, T&N makes it easier to structure learning, revisit past readings, and share one's own insights with others.
